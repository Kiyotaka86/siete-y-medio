# siete-y-medio
siete-y-medio

The goal is to be a repo for a game of 'siete y medio.' The game, which is similar to blackjack, is played between a player and a dealer. Each card has a given value, with Ace though Seven representing 1-7 and Jack, Knight and King representing 0.5.  Players can continue to draw cards while their total is less than 7.5, and beat the dealer if their total is closer to 7.5 than the dealer's total. If either of them goes over 7.5, it is considered a bust. 

When the player comes closer to 7.5 than the dealer without busting, the player wins and money increases by the bet amount. 
When the dealer comes closer to 7.5 than the player without busting, the dealer wins and player's money decreases by the bet amount.
When both bust, the player's money decreases by the bet amount. 
When both have the same total and do not bust, it is a tie.

Any contributions or bug reports are welcome, and the goal is to update over time with graphic elements and other methods of play.
